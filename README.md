# Registration Form
- "I've implemented a user-friendly registration form in my e-commerce web application using ReactJS and Spring Boot. The registration form, powered by the react-hook-form package, handles errors gracefully, preventing navigation to the home page if users input incorrect details. On the backend, I've developed register APIs, integrated with SendGrid for email alerts. The application ensures a secure login process by validating user credentials against the MySQL database, allowing successful logins to navigate to the home page."

# Backend MysqlWorkbench
- After users enter their details in the registration form on my e-commerce website, the information is securely stored in the MySQL database. If the entered credentials are correct, users can successfully log in and access the home page; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
